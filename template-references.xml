  	<desc>It's for chainloading some other rendercontrol at the end of this one, for example if the target will be generated by the current
template. It needs 3 attributes(target-ntturl-dataurl), and has one more optional attribute "mode" - those attributes corresponds to the method uno.xml.rendercontrol - however not normally useful beyon "#UNIQUEID#"- in the contents of this attributes the "CONSTANT" substitutions are available.<br/>Note that the functionality expressed by this particular node is just equivalent to adding a "onloadall" element in wich there is an uno.xml.rendercontrol instruction.
IT's preferable to use the node however, for example for further compatibility with UI-EDITOR - since it will know it's another template instead of any other javascript.</desc>

  	<desc>Rowtypes will be evaluated in the order in wich they are present in the template.<br/>
    The rowtype elements functionalities are the core of the rendercontrol system. It's a node that defines all the rules for transforming specific data. For example if we wanted to take all the nodes of type "book" from some xml data and render a list of it.<br/>
    First of all a rowtype has an attribute tagname, that can contain any XPATH expression matching to any number of same or different nodes presumed to be in the data document. If the xpath expression matches more nodes the rowtype will be "rendered" for all the nodes(except if limiting the number of repetions with the "max" attribute).<br/><br/>

    There is a limitless number of way to obtain substiutions that will ultimately be available in the html child node.
    That is the contents of the html node, substituted with all the "constant" substitutions and all the substitutions from the current row, WILL be renderend for each node matching the xpath expression.

  <desc>This page presents the possible structures of an ooox template. It's the xml definition for creating them. The "ooox template references".<br/>
ooox templates are written in XML.<br/>
Their primary pourpose is to transform (via ooox render engine) arbitrarily picked xml data into ANY STRING, customly generated javascript can also be evaluated in various handy way during the execution of the transform.<br/>
Is't roughly based on SELECTION and SUBSTITUTION, the main pattern being:<br/>
1-The template having means of indicating to the engine the data to select and assigning substitutions tokens (prefixedly unique)<br/>
2-Having the raw output necessary written in the template with the substitutions token in it, where needed.<br/>
However it's very smart and refined : heare a brief feature list:<br/>
-There is basically only <a href="#" onclick="var x=ooo.$$('onelineofcode');ooo.showhide([x],x.style.display=='none');return false;" style="text-decoration:underline">one line of code</a>, made of one simple instruction, that you to use 99% of times you need the engine.<br/>
<div style="margin:20px;display:none;" id="onelineofcode">-uno.xml.rendercontrol(target,'templateurl.xml','dataurl.xml');<br/>
-uno.xml.rendercontrol(target,'templateurl.xml','dataurl.xml',formelm); (for sending a form in the data request)<br/>
-uno.xml.rendercontrol(target,'templateurl.xml','dataurl.xml',false,onfinish); (for executing some handler at the end(that however should not be part of the render, since if integral with the template you would include them in the template itself.))<br/>
-uno.xml.rendercontrol(targetelm,'templateurl.xml','dataurl.xml',false,false,'append'); or 'insert' for having the output be appended or pushed as first child of target, instead of replacing it.</div>
-Supports automagic preload of templates used "inline" other templates.(So you can stick to you line of code.)<br/>
-Supports template recursion and chainloading in a number of different ways.(inlines, requiring preload, being only one of them)<br/>
-Perfect support of CDATA elements (often very useful in templates) and all possible use cases for special charactes.<br/>
-Allowing perfect match and single charachters and whitespaces fidelity to the template it allows for all "extreme" usages.<br/>
<br/>So It's important to understand that there are 2 basic levels of substitutions, we call them "CONSTANTS" and "VARIABLES":<br/>
"CONSTANTS" substitutions are fetched and prepared before and are generally always available.<br/>
"VARIABLES" substitutions are fetched and prepared for each matched row .</desc>
